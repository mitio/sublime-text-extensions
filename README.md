== SublimeText 2 Plugins

Here you can find some [SublimeText 2](http://sublimetext.com/2) plugins I've written to make this
great editor even more convenient.

== Installation

Each plugin usually spans only a single Python file.

To install these plugins, you just need to place the corresponding Python file into your
[SublimeText 2's `Packages` folder](http://sublimetext.info/docs/en/basic_concepts.html#the-packages-directory).
The location of this folder is OS-specific. You can find more details on the subject in the
[unofficial documentation](http://sublimetext.info/docs/en/extensibility/plugins.html).
